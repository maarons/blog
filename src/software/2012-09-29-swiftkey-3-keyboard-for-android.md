Google is celebrating 25 billion Play store downloads and giving great deals on
some of the apps — you can get the SwiftKey 3 keyboard for just $1.  I must say
that after two days of using this keyboard I found it incredibly convenient —
unlike the standard ICS keyboard this one offers useful predictions and supports
a multitude of languages.  Way to go!  I hope the standard keyboard gets this
good some day but for now SwiftKey 3 is the best mobile keyboard I’ve used.
