[html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) is a JavaScript library that
allows legacy Internet Explorer (versions 6 to 9) to recognise and properly
style HTML5 semantic elements, such as `<article>` or `<aside>`.  I haven’t
really bothered with supporting IE on my websites and frankly they looked
terrible in IE because the HTML5 semantic elements are not styled at all.  Well,
not any more!  This blog now uses html5shiv and looks much better in IE.

If you want to use HTML5 semantic elements but you want to support IE at the
same time you should look at html5shiv, maybe you’ll like it.  If you’re already
using HTML5 semantic elements you should consider adding html5shiv to your site
so it looks great in both modern and legacy browsers.
