Several years ago I found out about the [Tor project][tor] — an anonymity
network that can keep your on‐line actions from prying eyes.  Unfortunately back
then it was almost unusable.  Long connection delays meant you could get a
coffee between the time you clicked a link and the page actually loaded.

Today though I thought I’d try it again and man, was I surprised!  The set‐up is
easier than ever.  It’s basically install, run and point your browser to the
proxy created by Tor.  In the old days you had to configure the proxy manually
which wasn’t a very pleasant experience.  The best part though is the
performance — it is by no means fast, the connection delay is still noticeable
but differently than before it is usable.

I encourage you to check it out, go to [https://www.torproject.org/][tor] and
download Tor for your computer.
