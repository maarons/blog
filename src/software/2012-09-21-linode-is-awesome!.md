I have recently moved my [Linode][linode] hosted VPS to another data centre.
With Linode you do that by submitting a support ticket with the move request —
Linode staff then prepares your move and you can go through with it at your
convenience simply by clicking a button in Linode Manager.  The process is easy
and user friendly but the most amazing thing are the response times of the
support team.  It took them only *one minute* to respond to my ticket and
prepare the move — that is an almost instant response!  I could not be happier
with their service and I recommend it to everyone!  Go to
[http://www.linode.com][linode] and try them out.
