Iâ€™ve released a fourth release candidate for Shade 2.0.  This release fixes some
issues in the `storage` utility that prohibited it from working properly with
some storage devices.  In particular Android phones should work without problems
now.

You can get the newest release candidate from
[Github](https://github.com/maarons/Shade/zipball/2.0rc4).
